V1 => Specify version so that if we make some change, code does not break for existing users.

(Req, res) => this is called a route handler

Success / Fail(Client) / Error(Server)

#52 Handling GET Requests

	JSON.parse() => String becomes JS object

	varÂ obj = JSON.parse('{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}')

#53 Handling POST Requests

	Middleware => As name suggest, it stands b/w request and response => It can modify incoming request data 
	Out of the box, express does not put that data in request body => To have that We have to use middleware => app.use(express.json())
	Res.send() => We always need to send something to finish the request response cycle
	In JSON, every key should be in double quotes
	Always use async code inside callbacks(Non blocking)

	JSON.parse() => JS object to string

#54 Handling PATCH Requests

	Only send the data, which has to be updated. In PUT, we send the entire object 

#58 Middleware & The Request Response Cycle: 

	Middleware: Function that is called in between or receiving the request and sending the response.
	* We can say that in Express, everything is a middleware(Even routers)
		eg. express.json => body parser
	* The req and res objects go through each middleware, step by step.
	* We can think of it, like a pipeline.(Actually it is middleware stack)
	* The entire process of receiving an incoming request, going through all the middlewares and then sending the
	response back to the client is called, the request response cycle.

#59 Creating Our Own Middleware 
	If use app.use() => It will be tied to each and every request
	We need to call the next inside, because otherwise, the request response cycle will be stuck at that point.
	res.send() => Will end the req res cycle. Any middlewares after it, will be ignored.	

#60 Using 3rd Party Middleware
	Eg. Morgan => Logging the API
